!!!!21!>>......@#@#@#()dlksdjfoach for connectionist theory refinement. We present an algorithm for refining and extending the domain
 theory incorporated in a knowledge based neural network using constructive neural network learning algorithms. The initial domain theory
  comprising of propositional rules is translated into a knowledge based network of threshold logic units (TLU). The domain theory is
   modified by dynamically adding neurons to the existing network. A constructive neural network learning algorithm is used to add and
    train these additional neurons using a sequence of labeled examples. We propose a novel hybrid constructive learning algorithm based
